---This is a footballing app assessment project.
---It presents football fixtures, scorers, table, result, and teams. 
---It was developed using vue, vue-router vue-ex, coreui-vue.
---The hardest part to implement was customising the coreui-vue
---I am proud of the overall design, and the setup of the app.

---vue- this is the front end library used
---vueex- was used for state management
---vue-router- was used for routing to different pages
---coreui-vue- this is the ui framework that was used.

---This project was entirel developed by me
